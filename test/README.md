# Tests

These tests both test the library and serve as examples.

Each test has both an Ava and Jest example. They are functionally the same, except that the Jest examples also perform image snapshotting.

## `input_number.ts`

Basic example that shows off basic functionality

## `timer.ts`

Uses the `.narrow` method to select relevant parts of the card
